# AI-WEEK-7

## 🧠 Overview  
**AI-WEEK-7** is a collection of notebooks, assignments and materials related to weekly AI coursework / experiments (or specify what “week 7” refers to).  
It is built by **Waziri Shaban Waziri**. The goal is to provide structured learning and development around AI topics — useful both for personal learning and as a reference for others.

## 🚀 What’s inside  
- `assignment/` — your weekly assignment files (e.g. notebooks, scripts, data)  
- (Add more folders/files here if you have them: e.g. `notebooks/`, `data/`, `reports/` …)  
- (Optionally: link to a syllabus or description of what “week 7” covers)  

## ✅ Features / Why this is useful  
- Organised structure for a weekly AI curriculum  
- Clean, documented code / notebooks so others (or future you) can follow easily  
- Serves as a learning record and potential base for future AI projects
